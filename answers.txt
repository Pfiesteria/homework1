 What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a repository that exist on a different server or location form your local repository. It allows multiple developers to collaborate 
on the same project. 

What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge takes the changes from one branch to aonther while keeping the original branch's history. This is good
if you wish to keep clear branch histories when working with multiple people. A rebase takes the changes done to one branch 
and applies them to other branches which allows for more simple histories and reduces merge clutter.
